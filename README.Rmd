candidates

# 4 voters
# "V3" candidate voted by all, "V1" by half, "V2", "V4" once, "V5" was not voted at all
voters = list(
  c("V3", "V1", "V4"),
  c("V3", "V1"),
  c("V3", "V2"),
  c("V2", "V4")
)
voters

# voter weights
weights = c(1.1, 2.5, 0.8, 0.9)

# Approval voting (all voters equal)
rank_candidates(voters, candidates)

# Approval voting (voters unequal)
rank_candidates(voters, candidates, weights)

# Satisfaction Approval voting (voters unequal)
rank_candidates(voters, candidates, weights, method = "sav")

# Sequential Proportional Approval voting (voters equal)
rank_candidates(voters, candidates, method = "seq_pav")
```
