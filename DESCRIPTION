Description: A fast Rcpp-based implementation of polynomially-computable voting
    theory methods for committee ranking and scoring. The package includes
    methods such as Approval Voting (AV), Satisfaction Approval Voting
    (SAV), sequential Proportional Approval Voting (PAV), and sequential
    Phragmen's Rule. Weighted variants of these methods are also
    provided, allowing for differential voter influence.
