Description: A fast 'Rcpp'-based implementation of polynomially-computable
    voting theory methods for committee ranking and scoring. The package
    includes methods such as Approval Voting (AV), Satisfaction Approval
    Voting (SAV), sequential Proportional Approval Voting (PAV), and
    sequential Phragmen's Rule. Weighted variants of these methods are
    also provided, allowing for differential voter influence.
